Upon further reflection, I recognize that I not only presented myself unprofessionally but also disrupted the meeting’s productivity by creating tension. I see that I’ve put the team and the company in a difficult situation. \nI’ve privately reached out to my team members who were present to personally apologize for putting them in an uncomfortable spot. I’m committed to doing better in high-pressure situations and learning conflict-resolution strategies to help me communicate according to our company standards.\n I sincerely apologize for my mistake and will, of course, accept the consequences of my actions.",
